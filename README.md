This is my repository providing the python notebooks of my solutions.

Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification

Task: Build a model for classifying the images into lenses using PyTorch or Keras. Pick the most appropriate approach and discuss your strategy.

Specific Test III. Learning Mass of Dark Matter Halo 

Task: Using the provided dataset implement a regression algorithm to learn the mapping between lensing images and the lensing dark matter halo mass. You can use the machine learning algorithm of your choice.  Please implement your approach in PyTorch or Keras and discuss your strategy.

The specific test III is for both regression and updating the deeplens pipline, I'm interested in knowing more about both the projects but will happily select one as you see fit!
